Introduction
------------
Elastic Memory MD5 encryption Decryptor, Built as a project in Haifa University MSC in Joint course with the Technion as Client for a RaaS system Ginseng that was developed in the technion.

Contribution
------------
Our first contribution is a RaaS cryptographic elastic memory application that was extended to be used as a guest in Ginseng Architecture which is a RaaS based architecture and is a Market-Driven Memory Allocation service.
In this paper we first present our elastic memory cryptographic application, and in the second section we present our application as a guest in Ginseng.
Our second contribution is an application that queries the Cryptographic application for a given password to decrypt at a configurable rate. The application had been also extended to run as with the Ginseng service to benchmark our application.
